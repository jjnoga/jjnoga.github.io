                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hi there! My name is Joseph Noga, and I am currently an undergraduate at Quinnipiac University studying Computer Science as a major, with Mathematics as a minor. As someone with a great interest in working with computers and statistics, I enjoy working on collaborative projects to develop programs such as apps and games, collecting and organizing statistical data of any kind, and establishing connections with data scientists, computer scientists, mathematicians, and engineers in order to further my understanding of the technological world.</p>
    
                <p>I am a flexible worker, willing to partake in solo or collaborative efforts to contribute to a project or research at any time. I am driven, very organized, detail-oriented, and good at communicating with others to ensure healthy synergy in team-based efforts, both written and verbally. I have experience in fast-paced software development scrum cycles thanks to my experience at Quinnipiac, and I feel prepared to enter the workforce soon because of it. I am exceptionally self-discipled thanks to my eight years as a black belt in Tang Soo Do karate, and I always ensure to hold my duties and responsibilities with the utmost seriousness and urgency. I also possess skill with using Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Excel.</p>
