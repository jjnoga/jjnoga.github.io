                <h2>Witchy Cat</h2>
                <p>This project was a collaborative assignment between myself and four other people with heavy game design and software development experiemce. Together we created a short role-playing game about a cat named Anita, who is also a witch, searching for the next ingredients in her potion. The ingredients are found in different areas based on the seasons, and unique items are able to be wielded to access them. Software Engineering practices such as scrum meetings were put into practice during this project. Coding language: Java </p>

                <h2>Planets Helper</h2>
                <p>This project involved cooperation between me and a Software Engineering student in order to make a phone app (for Android) that retrieves information about particular planets of interests in the galaxy using SQL and JSON to do so. You can add favorite planets to a Favorites list that enables easier access to their information. The app also tells of recent news and discoveries regarding each planet. Please note that while the repo is under my partner's account, I still contributed heavily to it.</p>
